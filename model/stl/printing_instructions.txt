Part name	# of prints needed
--------------------------------
body_bottom	1x
body_top	1x
leg1		6x
leg1_seg1	6x
leg2_segA	6x
leg2_segB	6x
leg2_segC	6x
leg3_f		12x
leg_bond1_f	24x
leg_bond2_f	12x

Alternatively, instead of printing leg_segA,B and C, you can just print leg2.
However, that will require precisely calibrated printer. See the SolidWorks or SketchUp file for details.

Before printing, make sure that all the holes are the correct size. If you're using M3 bolts for the moving parts,
you will need the holes to have at least 3.25mm in diameter. The two bigger holes in leg2(_segA) are for the servo's gear axis.
Make sure their diameter is the same as the one of the gear axis on the servos you are using. 
In body_bottom, you will find rectangle-shaped holes for mounting the horizontal servos. 
Make sure they are big enough for the servos you will be using. To mount these servos, you will probably need to take them apart,
slide them in and reassemble them.
